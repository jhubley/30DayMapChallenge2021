Data from the EPA's [EnviroAtlas](https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/data-download-step-2)

[Data methodology and other information](https://enviroatlas.epa.gov/enviroatlas/DataFactSheets/pdf/ESC/Estimatedwalkingdistancetoaparkentrance.pdf)

The distances listed in the original dataset were in meters. I converted these to feet.
