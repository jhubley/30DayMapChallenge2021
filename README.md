# #30DayMapChallenge2021

A repo for the maps I make during the month for the #30DayMapChallenge. There'll be a lot of d3.js, some Svelte, deck.gl and more. I'm also hoping to experiment with tools that are new to me like Houdini. All projects will be in their own folders along with a readme that includes notes on build, data, etc.
