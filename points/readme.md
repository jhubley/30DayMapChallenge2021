## Prospect Park Trees

Original data source: [Prospect Park Treekeeper](https://prospectparkny.treekeepersoftware.com/index.cfm?deviceWidth=1680)
I split the "Species" field by using the parentheses around the scientific name as a delimeter. The "Species" column was then renamed "common," and the genus went in the "species" column. I added in the additional taxonomic ranks (Family, Order) by hand, using Wikipedia as a reference.
